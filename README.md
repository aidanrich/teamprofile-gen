# teamprofile-gen
## Description
- We were tasked with creating a node based app that would generate HTML containing a series of cards holding employee information.
- By using this generator you can easily create a page containing employee information simply by answering a series of prompts in the terminal.
- This project helped us learn about test/jest, export.module, Node js and the inquirer package.

## Installation
- You will need to use 'npm init' and 'npm i' in a command line while in the index.js file.
- This will give you access to both jest and inquirer, which are needed to run this app.
## Usage
- In the terminal instance use the 'node index.js' command. You will then be given prompts to answer. When finished an index.html file will be created in the 'dist' directory for your use.
